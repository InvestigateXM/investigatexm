<h1>NL-1331 Global Machina Research</h1>

<h2>Brunswick, Germany - 4th March, 2023</h2>

<p>Hello agents, and welcome to the NL-1331 Global Machina Research in Brunswick, Germany! Your help is needed to secure important research for the NIA in regards to a new, unexplained phenomenon codenamed &quot;Machina&quot;.</p>

<p>This will be the schedule for today:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Base Portal activated: 2023-03-04 13:30:00 local time</li>
	<li>Base Portal deactivated: 2023-03-04 14:00:00 local time</li>
	<li>Machina Research begins: 2023-03-04 14:00:00 local time</li>
	<li>Machina Research ends: 2023-03-04 16:00:00 local time</li>
</ul>

<p>While the Base Portal is activated, it will be ornamented and hacking it will provide a media drop with final instructions (including a map of the Artifact Portals).</p>

<p>During the timeframe of the Machina Research, the following will happen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Machina Portals are predicted to appear in massive numbers</li>
	<li>13 Research Shards will appear in the area</li>
	<li>10 Artefact Portals will be activated and special Media can be hacked from them</li>
	<li>A certain Portal will be designated as a Target Portal, however it is unknown which Portal will be designated</li>
</ul>

<p>Your task will be to control the Research Shards and bring them to the Target Portal. As the Target Portal is unknown, you&#39;ll need to work with your fellow agents to hack all 10 Artefact Portals. The media that can be hacked from these will be needed to determine the location of the Target Portal. A map of these Artefact Portals can be found below.</p>

<p>If you manage to bring all Research Shards to the Target Portal, the research into Machina is considered a success and every registered agent will recieve a point towards their NL-1331 Meetup medal.</p>

<p><strong>You will need to hack the Base Portal within the 30 minute time frame to register and be eligible to recieve a point for your NL-1331 Meetup medal.</strong></p>

<p>Make sure to collaborate with your fellow agents! Trying to complete the Machina Research solo will most likely end in failure. You can find the POCs for this event below:</p>

	<li>ENL POC: @GreenAgent</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck agents!</p>
